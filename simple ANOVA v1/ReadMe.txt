Description:
ONE WAY ANOVA/ SIMPLE ANOVA 
       Is a collection of cpp code that handles the task of ANOVA calculating as sufficient by the standards in Ambrose's ~ "Handbook of Biological Investigation 7th ed.""
       Caclulates everything, the only thing you have to do is run your F calculated by the F table appropo in the book (pg 57)
Contents:

1)     anovaMain.cpp has nothing but the beginning conditional to choose how many sets the ANOVA will have (3 and 4 supported only for now)
2)     anovaFuncts.cpp contains the contents of the entire mechanics of the program
3)     anovaMaster.h contains declarations of everything, functions and classes.
